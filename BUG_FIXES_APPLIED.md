## **🔄 What You Need to Do**

### **IMPORTANT: Install Flask-Session**

Since you already have the backend virtual environment activated, run:

```bash
pip install Flask-Session==0.5.0
```

Or reinstall all requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Restart the Backend**

After installing Flask-Session:

```bash
python3 run_backend.py
```

### **Frontend Should Still Be Running**

If you stopped it, restart:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
